# These are settings for mongo endpoint transition
#
# Available values of target are
# 1. src: nothing will happen
# 2. dst: mongo access will be transferred to dst from src
# 3. bak: mongo access will be transferred to bak from dst
#
# If target is dst and srcSessionEnd and dstSessionStart are valid ISO8601 format,
# then goapi will use srcSession before srcSessionEnd and dstSession after dstSessionStart,
# respectively.
#
# The time between srcSessionEnd and dstSessionStart is transition period. All mongo
# access will be rejected.
#
# bakSession is for backup in case dstSession has major issues after migration.
