# These are settings for redis endpoint transition
#
# Available values of target are
# 1. src: nothing will happen
# 2. dst: redis access will be transferred to dst from src
# 3. bak: redis access will be transferred to bak from dst
#
# If target is dst and srcPoolEnd and dstPoolStart are valid ISO8601 format,
# then goapi will use srcPool before srcPoolEnd and dstPool after dstPoolStart,
# respectively.
#
# The time between srcPoolEnd and dstPoolStart is transition period. All redis
# access will be rejected.
#
# bakPool is for backup in case dstPool has major issues after migration.
