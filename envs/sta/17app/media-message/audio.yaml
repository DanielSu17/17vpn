# This config is for audio message setting
#
# durationPrices MUST be ordered by durations
# Meaning of following durationPrices is:
#   0 < duration <= 5 seconds: 500
#   5 < duration <= 15 seconds: 2999
#   15 < duration <= 30 seconds: 4999
#
# giftIDTemplate is used for giftID format
# In this case, gift ids audio_message_4999 and audio_message_6999 must exist in table `Product`
# popupCount is used only for user experience. no logic here
