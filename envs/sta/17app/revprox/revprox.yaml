# 	throttling_start_point: 
#		the number of number of unique access_token that will trigger system throttling
# 	throttling_end_point: 
#		if the system is under throttling mode, and the number of number of unique access_token is lower than the @throttling_end_point for some time, the system will switch back to normal state

# 		the number of rotation for the bloom filtering library. Higher value will provide better accuracy for length of the measurement period. Suggested value: 10 - 100
#	throttling_block_request:
#		if this value = 1, then the revprox will block the request of new access_token.
