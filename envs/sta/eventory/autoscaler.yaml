#  schedules can help user to setup min pod number by datetime
#  it is useful for disposable job such as offline campaign, replay requirement for at the end of month
#
#  timeslotSchedules can help user to setup min pod number by time of day

#  the endTime must be greater than startTime. The case 'startTime: 23h30m0s endTime: 0h30m0s" is not validated.
#

#
#  schedules example
#    schedules:
#    - startTime: "2022-06-08 10:20:00 (GMT+0800)"
#      endTime: "2022-06-08 11:50:00 (GMT+0800)"
