# it is used for system throttling
#   throttling_measurement_period:
#     (unit in second), the measure period for system throttling
#   throttling_start_point:
#     the number of number of unique access_token that will trigger system
#     throttling
#   throttling_end_point:
#     if the system is under throttling mode, and the number of number of
#     unique access_token is lower than the @throttling_end_point for some
#     time, the system will switch back to normal state
#   throttling_rotation_num:
#     the number of rotation for the bloom filtering library. Higher value
#     will provide better accuracy for length of the measurement period.
#     Suggested value: 10 - 100
#   throttling_block_request:
#     if this value = 1, then the revprox will block the request of new
#     access_token.
#   throttling_max_sync:
#     the max number of retry on redis sync data, should be >= 1
