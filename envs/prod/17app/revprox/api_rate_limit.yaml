# it is used for system throttling
#   throttling_measurement_period:
#     (unit in second), the measure period for system throttling
#   throttling_start_point:
#     the number of number of unique access_token that will trigger system
#     throttling
#   throttling_end_point:
#     if the system is under throttling mode, and the number of number of
#     unique access_token is lower than the @throttling_end_point for some
#     time, the system will switch back to normal state
#   throttling_rotation_num:
#     the number of rotation for the bloom filtering library. Higher value
#     will provide better accuracy for length of the measurement period.
#     Suggested value: 10 - 100
#   throttling_block_request:
#     if this value = 1, then the revprox will block the request of new
#     access_token.
#   throttling_max_sync:
#     the max number of retry on redis sync data, should be >= 1

# For example:
#     any request match the regular expression "/v1/abc/[0-9]*/def" will be under
#     ratelimiting with QPS 100, and burst QPS = 200
# Remarks:
#     reservoir_size must be non-zero. Otherwise the leakybucket algorithm will fail.
#     reservoir_size should be larger than flow_per_second, otherwise the actual
#     allowed QPS may be lower than specified flow_per_second
# rate_limits:
# - url: "/v1/abc/[0-9]*/def"
#   method: "GET"
#   flow_per_second: 100
#   reservoir_size: 200

# FIXME
# The code above should be removed after token bucket helper is integrated into revprox.
# And the file should be filled in the new api rate limit content, which will be checked
# and applied by service/tokenbucket/helper.
