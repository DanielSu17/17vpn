# it is used for system throttling
# 	throttling_measurement_period: 
#		(unit in second), the measure period for system throttling
# 	throttling_start_point: 
#		the number of number of unique access_token that will trigger system throttling
# 	throttling_end_point: 
#		if the system is under throttling mode, and the number of number of unique access_token is lower than the @throttling_end_point for some time, the system will switch back to normal state
#	throttling_rotation_num:
# 		the number of rotation for the bloom filtering library. Higher value will provide better accuracy for length of the measurement period. Suggested value: 10 - 100
#	throttling_block_request:
#		if this value = 1, then the revprox will block the request of new access_token. 
#	throttling_max_sync:
#		the max number of retry on redis sync data, should be >= 1

# For example: 
#     any request match the regular expression "/v1/abc/[0-9]*/def" will be under ratelimiting
#     with QPS 1, and burst QPS = 5
# Remarks: 
#     reservoir_size must be non-zero. Otherwise the leakybucket algorithm will fail.
#     reservoir_size should be larger than flow_per_second, otherwise the actual allowed QPS may be lower than specified flow_per_second
